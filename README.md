# OT-Domain-Adaptation-Semantic-Segmentation
I apologize for the long-term lack of maintenance. Due to changes in my personal life and work, the current implementation may not perfectly match the method described in the original paperâ€”some details might differ. However, the core ideas and logic remain unchanged and should still serve as a useful reference. I intend to revisit and refine this code when circumstances permit in the future.
