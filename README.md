# OT-Domain-Adaptation-Semantic-Segmentation
# Description:
Hello! Welcome to our project code. This project is primarily about the design of a domain adaptation algorithm for semantic segmentation tasks in remote sensing images. Upon the publication of the related paper, we will release our code. Stay tuned!

# Data Description:
Certainly, we can start by setting up the dataset. I can guide you through the process. The primary datasets we use come from commonly used public datasets in the field of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for remote sensing. These include the ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets, as well as the UAVID dataset.These datasets are publicly available for download. If you don't want to make any changes and just want to download the data directly to use, we provide our Baidu cloud download link(https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zd9uuT8xd1xmGfN3_u17vg  code:edpz). A google cloud download link will be considered in the future.
